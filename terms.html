              of
              all parts and labour including the Price payable for it with the VAT element payable on it shown
              separately;</p>
          </li>

              9;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>All sums due will be payable within due date of the relevant invoice;</p>
          </li>
          <li>

              will begin no earlier than 30 days after the date of the relevant invoice;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>From the due date of payment until We take the action set out in sub-Clause 3.9, any outstanding sum
              will
              incur interest on a daily basis at 8% above the base rate of Bank of England from time to time until You
              make payment in full;</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Insurance Claims and Accident Damage</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>If the Work to be carried out on the Vehicle is the subject of an insurance claim, You (or the
              policyholder if he/she is not the same person) must sign any documents required by the insurer to be
              signed to authorise payment to Us for the Work;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>We shall not be responsible for any delay in completing the Work and/or returning the Vehicle to You
              where that delay arises out of any actions of the insurer including, but not limited to, the withholding
              of payment.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>The Work</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>We shall use reasonable endeavours to ensure that all parts required for the completion of the Work
              will
              be in stock to enable Us to carry out the Work when it is booked to be carried out but We will tell You
              if, due to non-availability of parts or a delay in their delivery, We are unable to begin the Work on
              the
              date We have arranged with You and to complete it within the total amount of the time referred to in
              sub-Clause 5.5;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>If We cannot carry out and complete the Work due to non-availability of parts or a delay in their
              delivery, then when We tell You that (as set out in sub-Clause 5.1), You may either make arrangements
              with
              Us for a re-booking or You may exercise Your right to cancel as set out in Clause 11;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>We shall agree with You before We begin the Work on all parts that We are going to use (except for
              those
              additional parts referred to in sub-Clause 5.6);</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>We shall only use parts for the Work that are new and either Manufacturer’s original parts or those
              produced by a third party and authorised by the Manufacturer. If We in any way intend not to abide by
              this
              requirement, We will tell You Our reasons for doing so and We may not do so unless You first explicitly
              consent;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>We will tell You before We begin the Work the amount of time We initially estimate that We will need to
              carry out the Work subject to any additional time needed under sub-Clause 5.6. We shall tell You
              promptly
              on discovering a need for such additional time and the reasons for needing it; </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>If We find during the course of the Work that We need to use additional parts and/or labour, We will
              only
              order additional parts or carry out additional Work if You first explicitly consent. For that purpose We
              will tell You immediately and give You an estimate for both the cost to You of additional parts and
              labour
              and also an estimate of the amount of additional time We need to carry out the additional Work;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>We will allow You an appropriate reduction in the Price to the extent that the time We take to carry
              out
              all of the Work:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>exceeds the total of the time We initially estimated under sub-Clause 5.5 and the additional time
                  We
                  estimated under sub-Clause 5.6; and </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>exceeds what is a reasonable time in all of the circumstances,
                  but a reduction will only apply to any part of the delay in the completion of the Work due to a
                  cause
                  within Our reasonable control;
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>If We replace any parts, We will make the original parts available to You to view and examine up to and
              including the time that You collect Your Vehicle. You may only remove those parts from the Garage if You
              will dispose of them in an environmentally responsible manner. If You do not wish to inspect and/or
              remove
              the parts, We shall dispose of them after You collect Your Vehicle; and</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>We shall use reasonable endeavours to ensure that We take good care of Your Vehicle and any of Your
              possessions inside it but We nevertheless advise You to remove all possessions from the Vehicle before
              We
              begin the Work.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Vehicle warranties</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>If the Vehicle is covered by a Manufacturer’s new vehicle warranty, anti-perforation warranty or
              rust/corrosion warranty at the time the Work is carried out, We shall carry out all of the Work in a way
              that adheres to the terms of those warranties and the Manufacturer’s specifications and documentation,
              using original or Manufacturer-authorised parts;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>If Our compliance with sub-Clause 6.1 causes Us additional cost, We will tell You of alternatives and
              will explain to You in full the consequences of those alternatives (including, but not limited to, the
              voiding of the Manufacturer’s warranties). The decision as to whether or not We will follow any such
              alternative shall be Your decision alone;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Before We begin any of the Work covered by a Manufacturer’s or a third party organisation’s warranty We
